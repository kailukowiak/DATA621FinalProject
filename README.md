We will be invistigating housing prices found on [House Prices: Advanced
Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

This course is on [Data Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining) so we will focus prediction instead of
causality. We will try several different optimzations to see if we can better
predict housing prices.
